## Who is my undergraduate chair?

Often we abbreviate _Undergraduate Curriculum Chair_ as just _Undergraduate Chair_. If you are in CIS, NETS, or DMD, your Undergraduate Curriculum Chair is [{{page.links.ugc_name}}]({{page.links.ugc_website}}) (not to be confused with the _CIS Department Chair_ [Zack Ives](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/)).

If you are in another department, check your department's web pages to see who your Undergraduate Curriculum Chair is.


## Should I make an appointment?

You are always welcome to talk with your undergraduate chair! However, while there are lots of forms that require
approval or a signature from your undergraduate chair, **if you have no questions about your request** you don't need to make an appointment. Common requests that don't need an appointment include late adds/drops, withdrawing from a course, switching to part-time status, applying for a second major or minor in CIS, switching majors into or out of CIS, or applying for an independent study. Note that many of these represent significant academic events, and you'll certainly want to speak with your [academic advisor]({% link advisor-meeting.md %}) or [the CIS Advising staff]({{page.links.cis_adv_home}}) about how this impacts your academic plan. After you've talked to someone, getting the form approved doesn't require a _separate_ appointment with the undergraduate chair.

* For the [university-level]({{page.links.path_forms}}) or [CIS department-level](https://forms.cis.upenn.edu/) online forms, you can simply submit them and they will be routed through the appropriate approval process, including the CIS Undergraduate Chair.

* If you have a PDF or paper form that needs a CIS Undergraduate Chair signature, after you have obtained the other required signatures you can drop the form off with [the CIS Advising staff]({{page.links.cis_adv_home}}) who are generally available during normal business hours. They'll get it to the CIS Undergraduate Chair for you.

## How do I make an appointment?

The [CIS Advising homepage]({{page.links.cis_adv_home}}) has appointment links.
