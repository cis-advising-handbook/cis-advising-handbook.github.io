So you already know how to program: can you skip <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> and go straight to <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>? If you have the [appropriate AP exam scores](https://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/preparing-for-admission/freshman-admission/external-exam-credit) then of course the answer is yes. For others, this is far from a straightforward question!

Before we get to the answer, let's start with a bit of background. The CIS curriculum is designed to start with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>,
an introductory programming class. We welcome students who have no programming experience - you will learn everything you need to know in <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>. However, sometimes incoming students indeed have sufficient programming experience from classes or projects that <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> isn't the right use of their time. So we do have an officially-sanctioned way for students to skip <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> and to start directly with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>.

However, skipping <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> is a bigger decision than it may appear at first. <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> lays the foundations that most of the 
following courses depend upon. If you skip <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> but later realize that your programming skills were not as good as you
thought, you may find yourself in a tricky situation. If you fail <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>, you have to repeat it and cannot move on to the
next courses in the intro sequence; this forces you into a kind of "holding pattern" where the only courses you
can take are non-CIS courses. You might also get a bad grade in <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>, which will likely compound into
a hard time in many of the following courses (<span class="tooltip">CIS 1210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 121</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">CIS 2400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 240</span></span>, ...) unless you work very hard to catch up on your
own. Keep in mind that you cannot repeat courses in which you have received a passing grade. Thus:

We strongly recommend against skipping <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>, unless you are very confident that you already know **ALL
of the material** it covers

## How should I decide whether I can safely skip CIS 1100?

You have probably heard many of your peers, and perhaps even your OPA, recommend that you skip <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>. However, please keep
in mind that everyone's situation is different. The OPAs tend to be among our strongest students, so it is entirely possible
that they skipped <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> and did very well, or that they found it easy or "boring" if they did take it. You should make your decision based 
on your own circumstances.

Start by looking at the <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> syllabus, and try doing some of the homework problems from the second half of the class.
Do these problems seem trivial to you? Do you find yourself smiling at how "easy" the topics on the syllabus are?
If so, you may be able to start with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>. But if there are homework problems that seem tricky to you, or if you
see some topics on the syllabus that you are not as comfortable with, it may be better to start with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>.

Even if you have some prior programming experience, keep in mind that <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> is taught in Java, and that Java is the 
programming language that many higher-level courses will expect. Strong programmers are often able to transfer their 
skills from one language to another, similar language (say, from C++ or C# to Java), but if your programming experience 
is in a language very different from Java you may be better off taking <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>.

{: .notice--danger}
If you are not sure what the best decision is, you should start with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>!

This is the "safe" decision: if you knew the material better than you initially thought, <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> will be an easy class for you; you can ace it 
and give your GPA a little boost. Also, if this is your first semester/year at Penn, it may make the transition to Penn a little bit 
easier, since your course load won't be as difficult and it can help you balance your time with your other classes and 
extracurricular activities. But if it turns out you were not as comfortable with the <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> material as you thought you would be, then <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> will 
bring you up to speed and make sure that you have a strong foundation that the higher-level classes can build on.

You can also discuss your plans with your academic advisor, or, if you have specific questions, the <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> or <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> instructors.

## Skipping CIS 1100

If you have read the rest of this article carefully and have come to the conclusion that starting with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> is right
for you, all you need to do is enroll in <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>. There is no need to get a waiver or permission from the department.
However, you will at some point need to take _another_ CIS or NETS [Engineering class](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/courses-requirements/engineering-courses/) later and count it in place of <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>.

### No retroactive credit

{: .notice--danger}
Taking <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> will **not grant retroactive credit for <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>**.

Some departments (like Math) offer retroactive credit for skipping an introductory course and taking a more advanced one instead. If you do well enough in the advanced course, you get a BOGO deal and get a CU for the introductory course _as well as_ the CU for the advanced course. Unfortunately, CIS does not have this policy. 

### Cannot take CIS 1100 later

Once you have taken <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>, you cannot go back and take <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> in a later semester. You must take a CIS or NETS [Engineering class](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/courses-requirements/engineering-courses/)
in its place, as described above.

## I am, like, *really* good at programming. Can I skip CIS 1200?

We get this question a lot, and we almost always recommend against it. While <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> truly is an intro programming class,
<span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> also contains many other aspects, such as functional programming and design patterns. These are just as important 
for the higher-level classes as the programming skills. Just because you are an excellent programmer does not 
necessarily mean that you also know about these other aspects.

If you are absolutely positive that you already know **all of** 
the material, you can contact the <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> instructor. If you can convince them, you can submit a [Core 
Requirement Substitution Form]({{page.links.cis_course_sub_form}}) and substitute another related class for <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span>. Keep in mind that the instructor must sign
off on this form, so please do not submit it unless you have already obtained approval from the instructor! These requests are 
approved only very rarely (in most semesters, we see zero approvals), simply because it is so unusual that someone 
would have mastered all of this material entirely on their own. If you know the material from another class (e.g., 
if you have transferred to Penn from another school), you should file an 
[XCAT request]({% link xcat.md %}) instead to transfer the credit to Penn.
