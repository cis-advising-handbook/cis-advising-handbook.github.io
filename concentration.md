A _degree concentration_ is a set of 4-6 related courses that you can use to specialize in a particular area. It is somewhat similar to a minor, except that the topic of a concentration is a particular sub-area of your major's discipline, whereas the topic of a minor is usually from a *different* discipline. For instance, a Computer Science student could pursue a minor in Mathematics, and a concentration in Computer Vision.

Many degrees within SEAS support concentrations. Concentrations serve two important functions:
1. to help you pick a good set of courses for your specialization
2. to serve as an additional credential. A completed concentration will appear on your transcript; thus, you can use it to demonstrate your competence in an area, e.g., to prospective employers

## Who can declare a concentration? Are they mandatory? How many can I declare?

For CIS degrees, **only students in the CSCI and CMPE programs** can currently declare concentrations. Other programs do not currently offer concentrations.

For both CSCI and CMPE students, concentrations are **optional**.

There is a **limit of one concentration per degree**. This is not to say that you cannot take classes in, or specialize in, more than one sub-area; however, only one of these areas can appear on your transcript as an official concentration.

For CSCI, concentrations were introduced with the new curricula for students entering in Fall 2020 or later, but older CSCI students are also able to declare a concentration. You can only take concentrations that are available with your current degree: a CSCI student cannot declare a CMPE concentration like _CHIPs_, or vice versa.

## Available concentrations

Please see the lists of [CSCI concentrations](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-program-options/concentrations/) and [CMPE concentrations](https://cmpe.seas.upenn.edu/curriculum-resources/).

## Does a concentration require extra classes?

No, a concentration does not require any extra classes. You can think of it this way: first, satisfy all your degree requirements. Then, look over the set of courses you took and if you satisfy the requirements for concentration A then you can get a "concentration A" label on your transcript.

Often, the concentration courses would be drawn from your Technical Electives. However, you can draw them from _anywhere_ on your CPG. You can also, of course, take extra courses, not required for your degree, to satisfy a concentration. The concentration courses just need to appear on your transcript with a passing grade.

## Declaring a concentration

You can declare a concentration [via this registrar form]({{page.links.path_major_minor_form}}). You can add, drop or change concentrations at any time.

## Substituting courses

The set of courses that count towards each concentration is fixed, and substitutions are not allowed.

## The concentration I want doesn't exist

Only the official concentrations [linked above](#available-concentrations) can appear on your transcript. However, you can obviously still take courses in, and specialize in, any area you are interested in! The department reviews the list of available concentrations periodically. If you have an idea for a new concentration, please reach out to undergraduate chair [{{page.links.ugc_name}}](mailto:{{page.links.ugc_email}})!
