This article outlines the underlying motivation and rules for the **Technical Electives** section of the 37CU CSCI degree requirements.

The term *technical elective* is unfortunately overloaded and used in several of our degrees:

* the [ASCS (BAS) degree's Technical Electives](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/computer-science-bas/) are more flexible, though everything approved on the list below *does count* for ASCS as well
* the [NETS](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/networked-social-systems-engineering-bse/) Technical Electives have different rules, not discussed here
* the [40CU CSCI](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/advising/all-degree-requirements/csci-requirements-2017/) Technical Electives have yet different rules again, though everything approved on the list below *does count* as a 40CU Technical Elective as well

With these provisos out of the way, the rest of this article focuses solely on the 37CU CSCI Technical Electives.

## The purpose of Technical Electives

Technical Electives give you technical depth; they are also an opportunity to specialize and to develop your own profile that goes beyond the required courses which everyone takes. Because of this, **not all courses are suitable as Technical Electives**. The expectation is that the courses will be 1) rigorous or quantitative, and 2) have at least one nontrivial prerequisite. Thus, a course that is mostly based on discussions or case studies will generally not work in this category. Such courses can still be wonderful, and you should certainly take them if you are interested! They would just have to go elsewhere on your CPG.

For some areas of specialization, it is necessary to take an introductory (1000-level) course first, e.g., because the other courses you want to take have it as a prerequisite. In this case, it is okay to count the 1000-level course as a Technical Elective, even if it does not meet the criteria above. However, **you can have no more than one 1000-level course** among your Technical Electives. Other 1000-level courses must go elsewhere on your CPG.

An excellent way to choose four of the technical electives is to [declare a concentration]({% link concentration.md %}). Courses from a declared concentration will automatically count as Technical Electives. However, please keep in mind that concentrations are optional for CSCI, and that there are many possible areas of specialization for which the department does not (yet?) offer a concentration. If you do not want to pursue a concentration, you can pick your own courses, subject to the constraints outlined in this article.

## Will my course count?

To avoid surprises at graduation time, it is important to make sure that a course counts as a Technical Elective *before* you take it. The easiest way to do that is to check the list below.

## My course is not on the list

If the course you are interested in is not yet listed, that does not necessarily mean that it does not count; it may simply mean that we have not made a decision yet. There are *lots* of courses that could be suitable, so we cannot maintain a definitive list! If your course is not yet listed, please [fill in this form]({{page.links.cis_te_form}}), and attach a recent syllabus. The department will make a decision and then add it to the list below.

Classifying courses isn't trivial, so please do this only for courses you actually want to take!

## List of courses

<div id="course_list"></div>

Below is the list of all classes whose eligibility as a Technical Elective has been determined thus far. If a course is listed as "ASK" (yellow), its classification depends on the circumstances; in this case, you should **always ask** by [emailing the CIS Undergraduate Chair](mailto:{{page.links.ugc_email}}) and attaching any relevant documentation. For instance, if you are asking about <span class="tooltip">CIS 0099<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 099</span></span>, please attach a copy of your project proposal.

For the curious, this list is also available [in JSON format](/assets/json/37cu_csci_tech_elective_list.json).

## 40 CU CSCI degrees

If you entered Penn in Spring 2020 or earlier and still have the "old" 40 CU worksheet, the rules for Technical Electives are slightly different. In this case, two of your Technical Electives **must** be [Engineering courses](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/courses-requirements/engineering-courses/). For the other 4 Technical Electives, you can count:
 1. any Math, Natural Science, or Engineering courses,
 2. an approved minor, or
 3. these specific courses: <span class="tooltip">LING 0500<span class="tooltiptext">formerly LING 106</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">PHIL 2620<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHIL 231</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">PHIL 2640<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHIL 244</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">OIDD 2200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly OIDD 220</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">OIDD 3210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly OIDD 321</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">OIDD 3250<span class="tooltiptext">formerly OIDD 325</span></span>

Other courses can be counted by special approval as a "sequence of approved courses".
