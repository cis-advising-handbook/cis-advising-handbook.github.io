This article outlines the underlying motivation and rules for the **Technical Electives** section of the 37CU CSCI degree requirements.

The term *technical elective* is unfortunately overloaded and used in several of our degrees:

* the Technical Electives for the [ASCS (BAS) degree](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/computer-science-bas/), the [ARIN degree](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/artificial-intelligence-bse/), and the [40CU CSCI degree](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/advising/all-degree-requirements/csci-requirements-2017/) are each a bit different, though everything approved (i.e., yes/unrestricted/restricted) on the CSCI list below *does count* as a Technical Elective for these degrees as well
* the [NETS](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/networked-social-systems-engineering-bse/) Technical Electives have different rules which are not directly comparable to the CSCI rules, and are not discussed here

With these provisos out of the way, the rest of this article focuses solely on the 37CU CSCI Technical Electives.

## The purpose of Technical Electives

Technical Electives give you technical depth; they are also an opportunity to specialize and to develop your own profile that goes beyond the required courses which everyone takes. Because of this, **not all courses are suitable as Technical Electives**. The expectation is that the courses will be 1) rigorous or quantitative, and 2) have at least one nontrivial prerequisite. Thus, a course that is mostly based on discussions or case studies will generally not work in this category. Such courses can still be wonderful, and you should certainly take them if you are interested! They just need to go elsewhere on your worksheet.

{: .notice--info}
The Tech Elective rules have changed notably for students entering in Fall 2024 and later. We enacted this change to allow for fine-grained classification of courses that is independent of course number, as sometimes introductory courses have high course numbers, and in-depth courses have 1000-level numbers.

To avoid surprises at graduation time, it is important to make sure that a course counts as a Technical Elective *before*
you take it. The easiest way to do that is to check [the list below](#list-of-courses).

## Rules for students entering Fall 2024 and later

Students can have at most 1 CU of **restricted** courses in their Technical Electives. The remaining CUs must be fulfilled with **unrestricted** courses. For courses that are marked **ask**, the undergrad chair will determine whether the course is unrestricted, restricted or cannot count.

## Rules for students entering before Fall 2024

Students can have **no more than one CU of 1000-level coursework** among their Technical Electives. Additional 1000-level courses must go elsewhere on the worksheet. Only courses that are marked as **yes** in the table below, or that are marked **ask** and have been approved by the undergrad chair, can be used as TEs.

## My course is not on the list

If the course you are interested in is not listed, that does not necessarily mean that it does not count; it simply means that we have not considered the course yet. If your course is not yet listed, please [fill in this form]({{page.links.cis_te_form}}) and attach a recent syllabus. The department will make a decision and then add it to the list below.

{: .notice--info}
Classifying courses isn't trivial, so please do this only for courses you actually want to take!

## List of courses

<div id="course_list"></div>

Below is the list of all classes whose eligibility as a Technical Elective has been determined thus far. If a course is listed as **ask**, its classification depends on the circumstances; in this case, you should **always ask** by [emailing the CIS Undergraduate Chair](mailto:{{page.links.ugc_email}}) and attaching any relevant documentation. For instance, if you are asking about <span class="tooltip">CIS 0099<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 099</span></span>, please attach a copy of your project proposal.

For the curious, this list is also available [in JSON format](/assets/json/37cu_csci_tech_elective_list.json).

## 40 CU CSCI degrees

If you entered Penn in Spring 2020 or earlier and still have the "old" 40 CU worksheet, the rules for Technical Electives are slightly different. In this case, two of your Technical Electives **must** be [Engineering courses](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/courses-requirements/engineering-courses/). For the other 4 Technical Electives, you can count:
 1. any Math, Natural Science, or Engineering courses,
 2. an approved minor, or
 3. these specific courses: <span class="tooltip">LING 0500<span class="tooltiptext">formerly LING 106</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">PHIL 2620<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHIL 231</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">PHIL 2640<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHIL 244</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">OIDD 2200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly OIDD 220</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">OIDD 3210<span class="tooltiptext">formerly OIDD 321</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">OIDD 3250<span class="tooltiptext">formerly OIDD 325</span></span>

Other courses can be counted by special approval as a "sequence of approved courses".
