Each department has their own way of handling Permission Requests; this article is just for CIS/CIT/NETS courses.

We would love to offer our classes to any Penn student who is interested! However, demand is so high for some of the CIS/CIT/NETS classes that we cannot let everyone in and still do a good job of teaching. Because of this, the number of students who can enroll during Advance Registration is typically capped, and we maintain waitlists for students who would like to take a given class but did not get in.

## Waitlist overview

The Waitlisty system builds on the Permission Request (PR) functionality built into Path@Penn. Waitlisty allows us to admit students to a course in a prioritized fashion, instead of a mad dash whenever a slot opens up. Sometimes a waitlist course may have open slots, but this is a mirage because you can't register for that open slot until your PR is approved.

Being on the waitlist means that there is **no guarantee** that you will be able to enroll in that course. Because of this, **you must have a fallback plan** in the event that you cannot take the waitlisted course. For instance, you could tentatively enroll in a different class that will satisfy another degree requirement, and plan to take the waitlisted class in a future semester.

You should always use Advance Registration to get into high-demand courses when possible. If you get in during Advance Registration then you don't have to worry about the waitlist at all!

## Which classes use Waitlisty

If you cannot register directly for a course on Path (or add it to your Primary Cart in Advanced Registration), and it's a CIS, CIT or NETS course, the course uses the Waitlisty system to manage Permission Requests.

There are a variety of specific messages you may see on Path. Sometimes **all students** have to go through Waitlisty:

![Path permit-required course]({% link /assets/images/permit-required-path.png %})

Sometimes students with certain majors can register directly, but other majors need to use Waitlisty:

![Path grad-only course]({% link /assets/images/enrollment-restricted-grad-course-path.png %})

This message above lists all of the graduate programs in CIS (here, _Computer & Information Science_ refers specifically to our [CIS Master's degree](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-cis/)), so CIS grad students can register directly but everyone else (e.g., CSCI undergrads) has to use Waitlisty.

The _Special Permission_ restriction takes priority over major restrictions, so if you see both then it means everyone has to use Waitlisty. Path always has the definitive information on how to register for a course.

## Using Waitlisty

{: .notice--danger} 
**Please do not reach out to individual faculty with permission requests!**

{: .notice--info}
See our [short video of how to request permission](https://bit.ly/3Ru2uVr) for a course.

The first step is **submitting a PR via Path** for a waitlist course (see our instructions below or [official ones from SRFS](https://srfs.upenn.edu/path-at-penn)). You can submit PRs just before and during Advance Registration, and we encourage you to do so.

A PR is always created for a specific course and section. If you created a PR for a recitation but actually need to get into the lecture (or the undergrad version of a cross-listed course but you want the grad version instead), you will have to create a new PR. PRs *cannot* be edited after the fact.

{: .notice--info}
You can, somewhat unfortunately, submit a PR for _any_ course, even ones that you can register for directly. Don't submit a PR [unless the course requires it](#which-classes-use-waitlisty) - just go ahead and advance-register or regular-register!

Find the course in Path and click *Add to Cart*. Then, click *Request permission for this course*:

![Path permission request part 0]({% link /assets/images/perm-request-0.png %})

It doesn't matter which cart you use. Type something brief in the _Permission Request_ field; we'll follow-up with course-specific questions later. For now, just hit _Ok_...
![Path permission request part 1]({% link /assets/images/perm-request-1.png %})

...and finally, _Save Changes_.
![Path permission request part 2]({% link /assets/images/perm-request-2.png %})

After Advance Registration results are announced, we'll follow up via email to direct you to the [Waitlisty website]({{page.links.cis_waitlist}}) where you may need to complete course-specific information like explaining how you satisfy the pre-reqs, why you want to take the course, etc. You must submit a PR via Path to gain access to this site.

## Prioritization

To prioritize students on the waitlist, we consider how urgently each student needs to take the class. For instance, if both a NETS student and a CSCI student want to take <span class="tooltip">NETS 2120<span class="tooltiptext">formerly NETS 212</span></span>, we give priority to the former because <span class="tooltip">NETS 2120<span class="tooltiptext">formerly NETS 212</span></span> is specifically required for the NETS student, while the CSCI student is taking <span class="tooltip">NETS 2120<span class="tooltiptext">formerly NETS 212</span></span> as a CIS Elective or Technical Elective which have lots of alternatives. Timing matters, too: perhaps this is a student's last opportunity to take the class before they graduate.

## When will decisions be made?

PRs are processed periodically from when Advance Registration results are announced until the end of the Add/Drop/Swap period. You could receive permission during the first few weeks of the semester. 

We are unfortunately not able to notify you that you will *not* be receiving permission, since course enrollment fluctuates right up until the Add/Drop/Swap deadline.

## Approved Permission Requests

If your PR is approved, you’ll receive a notice from Path. You then have a chance to register for the course in Path.

{: .notice--danger}
If your PR is approved but the class is full, **you cannot register**.

Due to an inability to revoke approved PRs and, as a result, students sitting on approved-but-unused PRs, waitlist courses are often mildly oversubscribed. Thus, an approved PR is no guarantee that you'll be able to register for a course. So always use an approved PR right away!

Once you've registered for a waitlist class, please be careful not to accidentally drop it. If you do this, we **cannot guarantee** that you will be able to register again!


## Leaving the waitlist

If you are no longer interested in registering for a waitlist course, you should withdraw your request. You can do so via the [Waitlisty site]({{page.links.cis_waitlist}}).


## Problems with Waitlisty

If you encounter any bugs while using the Waitlisty website, you can file an issue on [our Github repo](https://github.com/upenn/waitlisty-issues).
