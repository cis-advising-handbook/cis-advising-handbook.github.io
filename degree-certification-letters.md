If you have **already received** a degree from Penn Engineering, we'd be more than happy to provide a letter. There is [an OUR digital form]({{page.links.seas_letter_form}}) to submit your request.

If you have **not yet** graduated, we cannot provide such a letter since we cannot be truly sure that you are going to receive a degree until your final grades are in, and until a number of checks have been performed (e.g., to see that all graduation requirements have been satisfied).
