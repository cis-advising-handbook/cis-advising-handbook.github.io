To help you with planning your courses each semester, we've put together two sample schedules for the CSCI degree. These sample schedules assume no incoming AP course credit.

There are **many** paths through the degree requirements, and these sample schedules each represent just one possible path. There is intentionally a lot of flexibility to accommodate each student's interests and preferences. We hope these sample schedules will be a starting point for you to plan your own 4-year journey through the degree. As you begin to fill in and customize your 4-year plan, you'll want to check the [official degree requirements](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/advising/all-degree-requirements/csci-requirements-2020/), the [SEAS Undergraduate Handbook]({{page.links.seas_ugrad_hbook}}), consider a [degree concentration]({% link concentration.md %}), and read other articles here that discuss [degree requirements](/tag_index/#rules).

## Start with CIS 1100

This first sample schedule starts with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>, our recommended entry point into the CSCI degree.

Solid arrows indicate course pre-requisites, e.g., <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> requires <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>. Hollow arrows indicate co-requisites, e.g., <span class="tooltip">PHYS 0150<span class="tooltiptext">formerly PHYS 150</span></span> requires that you have already taken <span class="tooltip">MATH 1400<span class="tooltiptext">formerly MATH 104</span></span> or that you take it in the same semester.

We first observe that no semester requires more than 5 CUs, and half of the semesters have only four classes. We have scheduled these lighter semesters deliberately. In the first year, 4 courses per semester helps students adjust to college life and classes at Penn. In junior fall, we chose 4 CUs because <span class="tooltip">CIS 3200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 320</span></span> and especially <span class="tooltip">CIS 4480<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 3800</span></span> are both difficult classes. <span class="tooltip">CIS 4480<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 3800</span></span> is also typically a fall-only course, and <span class="tooltip">CIS 4710<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 471</span></span> a spring-only course. Senior fall is 5 CUs but two of them are non-STEM courses from Social Science, Humanities or Technology, Business & Society (see the [degree requirements]({% link degree-requirements.md %}) article for more details). A lighter senior fall is desirable to free up time for job interviews, which often require travel and missing class. Finally, senior spring is an easy semester as a concession to so-called "senioritis", though you might prefer to take a 5th class in senior spring to lighten your load elsewhere.

## Start with CIS 1200

Since many folks [skip <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>]({% link skip-1100.md %}) and start with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> instead, we have put together a schedule that begins with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1200<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 120</span></span> instead.

This schedule takes into account the same general considerations as the schedule with <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> ([above](#start-with-cis-1100)). There is an additional CIS Elective required to [take the place of <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span>]({% link skip-1100.md %}) (we put it in sophomore fall, but it could go many other places, too).

You'll also notice that the two schedules are essentially converged starting in sophomore spring. Taking or skipping <span class="tooltip">CIS 1100<span class="tooltiptext">formerly CIS 110</span></span> doesn't have any real impact beyond the first few semesters.
